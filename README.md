This repository serves as a central location for all these models, documenting the work completed and providing code for others to replicate or build upon.

## Models Included

The repository includes the following models:

1. **NLP Models:**
   - Sentiment Analysis Model
   - Text Classification Model
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model

2. **Computer Vision Models:**
   - Image Classification Model
   - Object Detection Model
   - Facial Recognition Model

3. **Other Models:**
   - Predictive Analytics Model
   - Anomaly Detection Model

Each model is stored in its respective directory, containing code, data (if applicable), and documentation.

## Installation

To run the models in this repository, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

The main dependencies for these models include:

- Python (3.x)
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (depending on the model)
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV (for Computer Vision models)
- NLTK / SpaCy (for NLP models)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nerry-AXL/Nerry-AXL-ElevateAI-all_task_models-.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Nerry-AXL-ElevateAI-all_task_models-
    ```

3. **Run a specific model:**
   Navigate to the directory of the model you want to run and execute the corresponding script. For example, to run the Sentiment Analysis Model:

    ```bash
    cd NLP/Sentiment_Analysis
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

4. **View Results:**
   Results will be outputted in the terminal, saved to a file, or visualized, depending on the model.

## Model Details

### NLP Models

- **Sentiment Analysis Model:** Classifies text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data and uses techniques such as tokenization, embedding, and LSTM layers.

- **Text Classification Model:** Categorizes text into predefined categories. It uses a combination of word embeddings and neural network architectures to achieve high accuracy.

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model:** Identifies and classifies entities (e.g., names, locations, dates) within a text. The model is built using a sequence labeling approach.

### Computer Vision Models

- **Image Classification Model:** Classifies images into different categories. It is trained on a dataset of labeled images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

- **Object Detection Model:** Detects and classifies objects within an image. It uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) or another object detection algorithm to achieve real-time detection.

- **Facial Recognition Model:** Identifies and verifies individuals in images or video frames. The model uses deep learning techniques to extract and compare facial features.

### Other Models

- **Predictive Analytics Model:** Predicts future outcomes based on historical data. It uses regression or classification algorithms, depending on the task.

- **Anomaly Detection Model:** Identifies unusual patterns or outliers in data. It is particularly useful in fraud detection, network security, and industrial monitoring.

## Results

Each model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and more. Detailed results and analysis can be found in the respective directories.
